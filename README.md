# dev-utils
Stores development utilities that I've written that might be helpful.

## knitrmd
Simple utility to knit .rmd file from the command line.

## pull-git-log
Does what it says: looks for git repos and pulls commits from the past $n$ days according to a unique identifier, usually the developer's username.

## get-largest-files
Crawl the user's filesystem, starting in `.`, to find the top 10 largest files. Useful for when your `/home` is full on a shared compute resource, and you have no idea why.

## watch-sbatch
Watch the `$USER`'s `sbatch` job submissions on an HPC like U-M's Great Lakes.

## dean
Coding assistant built on ollama, named after computer scientist and IBM engineer [Mark Dean](https://www.ibm.com/history/mark-dean). In *very* early development, so I'll have more to say later. (Now deprecated, but I may return to the project with a different vision in the future.)
